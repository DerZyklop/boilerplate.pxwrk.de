# boilerplate.pxwrk.de

## Install

Navigate to your project. **Create a temporary package.json via `npm init`**.

```
npm install DerZyklop/boilerplate.pxwrk.de
sh node_modules/boilerplate.pxwrk.de/init
npm install
grunt
```

## Wat is it?

This is my personal project-boilerplate.

I wouldn't recommend to use it as it is for your project. It's not documented.
It's just a collection ofÂ files, that i use in almost every project.
